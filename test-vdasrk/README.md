Here is a detailed README for a Terraform configuration using VPC, S3, and Lambda AWS services:

# Terraform AWS Configuration

## Description

This Terraform configuration sets up a VPC, S3 bucket, and Lambda function. The VPC and subnets provide the networking infrastructure. The S3 bucket stores files that can be accessed by the Lambda function. The Lambda function is triggered to perform processing on files added to the S3 bucket.

## AWS Well-Architected Framework

### Security

- The VPC is configured with security groups to restrict access to the Lambda function and S3 bucket. Only necessary ports are exposed.
- The S3 bucket has versioning enabled to preserve objects and recover from accidental deletions or overwrites. 
- The Lambda function runs with minimum privileges through an IAM execution role.
- API Gateway authorizers are used to authenticate users calling the Lambda function.

### Reliability

- The Lambda function code handles errors gracefully to prevent crashes or hangs.
- S3 replication is configured to copy objects across AZs for redundancy.
- Resources are spread across multiple availability zones for high availability.
- CloudWatch metrics and alarms are configured to monitor for anomalies.

### Performance Efficiency

- Lambda functions are configured with optimal memory to match processing requirements.
- Unused VPC subnets in remote regions are removed to reduce costs.
- S3 lifecycle policies transition objects to Infrequent Access and Glacier for cost savings.

### Cost Optimization  

- Reserved instances are used for reliable workloads to reduce EC2 costs.
- Lambda functions are configured to scale to 0 to avoid charges when idle.
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering moves data between access tiers based on usage patterns.
